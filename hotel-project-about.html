    <h1>About Canoe.com</h1>
      <p>Canoe.com was created by up and coming web developers, Matt Shapiro and Carolyn Tevnan.
      During week five of Rutgers Coding Bootcamp their instructor, Shamoon charged them with the
      task of creating a fully functional travel webpage. After they ate Thanksgiving dinner with 
      their respective families, they did just that. When Matt and Carolyn are not busy with schoolwork,
      they both enjoy traveling. They agree that an ideal travel destination is Cape Cod. </p>
